# Times-Tables-Intermediate-and-Hard

## Intermediate difficulty

Write a function, oddTimesTables, that will print only the odd numbers from the multiplication tables up to 12x12.

```
Function Name: oddTimesTables
Output:
1 3 5 7 9 11
3 9 15 21 27 33
5 15 25 35 45 55
7 21 35 49 63 77
9 27 45 63 81 99
11 33 55 77 99 121
```
    
- You must explain your submission to be able to win!
- You can reason which numbers will be odd based on the patterns in multiplication tables, but whatever method you choose, you should also write a test that makes sure that the numbers to be printed are indeed odd.

## Hard Difficulty

Write timesTables and oddTimesTables as efficiently as possible.

- Donâ€™t forget to explain your submission just as you would do in a job interview setting!

# My submission

Even though the challenge specified an `oddTimesTables` function, I can't be bothered doing the beginner challenge so I'm knocking both off in one.  

Also, this source file is backwards compatible due to the lack of booleans and `//` comments. Why? Because I'm an elitist!  

... actually, it's only because I forgot typedef syntax. :/  

The code is commented!
